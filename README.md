# Service Principal Terraform Module

Terraform module to create a service principal and assign required built-in roles. The outputs from this module, like application_id and password, can be used as an input in other modules.

To create a service principal and assign roles to the resources, this module needed elevated access in both Azure AD and Azure subscription. Therefore, it is not suggested to run from any CI/CD pipelines and advised to run manually to proceed with automated methods.

## Module Usage

```hcl
module "service-principal" {
  source  = "kumarvna/service-principal/azuread"
  version = "2.0.0"

  service_principal_name     = "simple-appaccess"
  password_rotation_in_years = 1

  # Adding roles and scope to service principal
  assignments = [
    {
      scope                = "/subscriptions/xxxxx000-0000-0000-0000-xxxx0000xxxx"
      role_definition_name = "Contributor"
    },
  ]
}
```

## Create a service principal with a certificate

When you have an app or script that needs to access resources, you can set up an identity for the app and authenticate the app with its own credentials. This identity is known as a service principal. This approach enables you to:

* Assign permissions to the app identity that are different than your own permissions. Typically, these permissions are restricted to exactly what the app needs to do.
* Use a certificate for authentication when executing an unattended script.

This module creates the service principal using a certificate. This can be enabled by setting up `enable_service_principal_certificate = true` and provide the valid certificate path using the argument `certificate_path`.

```hcl
module "service-principal" {
  source  = "kumarvna/service-principal/azuread"
  version = "2.0.0"

  service_principal_name               = "simple-appaccess"
  enable_service_principal_certificate = true
  certificate_path                     = "./cert.pem"
  password_rotation_in_years           = 1

  # Adding roles and scope to service principal
  assignments = [
    {
      scope                = "/subscriptions/xxxxx000-0000-0000-0000-xxxx0000xxxx"
      role_definition_name = "Contributor"
    },
  ]
}
```

## Create X.509 Certificate with Asymmetric Keys

To create a self signed SSL certificate, execute the following OpenSSL command, replacing the -days and -subj parameters with the appropriate values:

```sh
openssl req -x509 -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -out cert.pem -nodes -subj '/CN=simple-appaccess'
```

This command will create two files: `cert.pem` and `privkey.pem`. The `cert.pem` file contains the X.509 certificate with public key. This certificate will be attached to the Active Directory Application. The `privkey.pem` file contains the RSA private key that will be used to authenticate with Azure Active Directory for the Service Principal.

When self-signed certificates are not sufficient, sign your certificate using a Third-Party Certificate Authority such as Verisign, GeoTrust, or some other Internal Certificate Authority by generating a certificate signing request (CSR).

## Password rotation using `time_rotating`

Manages a rotating time resource, which keeps a rotating UTC timestamp stored in the Terraform state and proposes resource recreation when the locally sourced current time is beyond the rotation time. This rotation only occurs when Terraform is executed, meaning there will be drift between the rotation timestamp and actual rotation.

## Assign the application to a role

To access resources in your subscription, you must assign the application to a role. Decide which role offers the right permissions for the application. To learn about the available roles, see RBAC: [Built in Roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

You can set the scope at the level of the subscription, resource group, or resource. Permissions are inherited to lower levels of scope. For example, adding an application to the Reader role for a resource group means it can read the resource group and any resources it contains. To allow the application to execute actions like reboot, start and stop instances, select the Contributor role.

```hcl
module "service-principal" {
  source  = "kumarvna/service-principal/azuread"
  version = "2.0.0"
  
  # .... omitted

  # Adding roles and scope to service principal
  assignments = [
    {
      scope                = "/subscriptions/xxxxx000-0000-0000-0000-xxxx0000xxxx"
      role_definition_name = "Contributor"
    },
  ]
}
```
